    "\n",
    "To have a clean database in the EO-Compass and the data cubes, we need an id generator which generates reliably identical ids for identical images and distinct ids for distinct images. In this way, a UNIQUE constraint in the metadata table is able to prevent duplicate entries. The semantics of what identical images are is not the job of the database."
